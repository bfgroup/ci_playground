= Continuous Integration Playground

This is a "playground" for testing out basic methods to get Cloud CI systems
working with minimal effort. Not just getting any CI working, but specifically
getting C++ to work in CI.

== Goals

This project is of limited scope. In particular it follows these goals:

*C+\+*: Sufficient support to install and use a C\++ toolset to compile and
run C++ programs.

*Free*: We only consider services that are available to use for free to some
capacity. This usually means that the compute resources and features are
limited.

*Simple*: The configurations are as simple as possible to get specific toolsets
working and nothing more. This means there is no build system setup. And the
few small scripts used are there to minimize duplication.
